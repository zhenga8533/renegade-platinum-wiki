# Welcome to BBVW2 Redux

## :material-information: General Notes

!!! info "About This Project"

    This project began life as a fan-made modernisation of Dray's Pokémon Black 2 and White 2 ROM hack, **Blaze Black 2** and **Volt White 2**.

    It has since blossomed into a full-on reimagining of the project, in collaboration with **Drayano himself**!

With Dray's original project nearing a decade in age (and indeed, the original titles!), Redux is naturally a significant jump in content from the original.

-   Redux is much closer to **Renegade Platinum** in terms of content than it is to the original Blaze Black 2 and Volt White 2.

!!! warning "Hardware Compatibility"

    The implementation of the Fairy type is known to have issues and _can_ fail to run on original hardware - thus **an emulator is recommended** to play.

    See the [Known Bugs](getting_started/known_bugs.md) document for more information.

## :material-download: Patching Info

!!! success "Quick Start"

    Patch a **clean Pokémon Black 2 or White 2 ROM** you've legally obtained.

!!! danger "Important Warning"

    **Do NOT** attempt to use this patch with the original Blaze Black 2 or Volt White 2, or else the process will fail!

For detailed patching instructions, see the [Patching Guide](getting_started/patching_guide.md).

## :material-sword-cross: Difficulty Modes

Black and White 2 feature an inbuilt difficulty selection system. **Redux has expanded upon this significantly.**

!!! note "Trainer Aesthetics Preserved"

    Across all difficulties, trainers retain their aesthetics from the original Black 2 and White 2, including their type focuses and signature Pokémon.

=== "Normal Mode"

    **The Standard Drayano Experience**

    Equivalent in difficulty to **Renegade Platinum** or the original BB2/VW2.

    **Features:**

    - Trainers stick to single battles (mostly)
    - Much greater challenge than vanilla B2/W2
    - Expect Pokémon to faint without proper strategy
    - Gym leaders start with fewer Pokémon, building to full teams of six

    **Recommended for:** Players familiar with enhanced ROM hacks

=== "Easy Mode"

    **A Casual, Laid-Back Experience**

    Perfect for experiencing the new changes to Unova without difficulty heartache.

    **Features:**

    - Same trainer teams as Normal Mode
    - **Reduced Pokémon levels**
    - **Lower AI difficulty**
    - Explore content at your own pace

    **Recommended for:** New players or casual playthroughs

=== "Challenge Mode"

    **For Series Veterans**

    In the era of Radical Red, many crave a challenging Pokémon experience with vanilla feel. Redux delivers on both accounts.

    **Battle Changes:**

    - Gym leaders use **full teams of six from the start**
    - Important trainers use a mix of **Single, Double, and Triple battles**, for example:
        - **Burgh** → Double battle
        - **Elesa** → Triple battle
        - Each **Elite Four** member uses a different format
    - Exclusive encounters, for example:
        - **Lance**
        - Double battle with **Lenora & Cheren**

    **Difficulty Scaling:**

    - Regular trainers have dynamically scaled levels (based on badges)
    - Scales up to **+7 levels** depending on area
    - Important trainers generally **don't use items** (prevents AI abuse)

    **Resource Management:**

    - Far fewer items given to the player
    - Limited item farming opportunities
    - **BP exchange cashiers vanish until postgame**

    **Recommended for:** Experienced players seeking maximum challenge

## :material-tune: Complete vs Classic

Not everyone is a fan of Dark/Electric Luxray, Intimidate Fearow or 600BST Flygon.

=== "Complete"

    The default version with **custom buffs and changes** to Pokémon abilities, movesets, and type combinations.

    Examples include Serperior as Grass/Dragon, Luxray as Dark/Electric, Weavile with Technician, Butterfree with higher BST, and Flygon with 600 BST.

=== "Classic"

    For players who prefer a more traditional experience, the **Classic version strips these changes back**.

    Pokémon are only updated to match their **Gen VIII appearances** - think Fairy Type Togekiss and Drought Torkoal, etc.
