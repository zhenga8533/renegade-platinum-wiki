## Minor Fossil Issues

!!! bug "Severity: Low"

    **Location:** Desert Resort (Relic Castle)

    **Cause:** Known

**Description:**

When taking multiple Fossils to the woman in the Relic Castle, there's a minor visual bug when you select which fossils you'd like to revive.

**Impact:**

-   This is purely visual and can safely be ignored
-   Functions correctly despite the visual glitch

**Technical Details:**

The bug arises because the game expects the woman to be in the museum, but she isn't. Since the script is called from and shared with elsewhere in the game, it's unlikely this can be fixed.

## Stone Animations

!!! bug "Severity: Very Low"

    **Location:** Dragonspiral Tower

    **Cause:** Known (Version exclusive content)

**Description:**

The animation for the Black/White stone absorbing energy is version exclusive. Thus, when you encounter Reshiram (Blaze Black 2 Redux) or Zekrom (Volt White 2 Redux), the animation doesn't play.

**Impact:**

-   You still see the cool 3D cutscene though!
-   Does not affect gameplay
