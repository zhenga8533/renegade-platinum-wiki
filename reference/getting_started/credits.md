!!! info "About This Project"

    Pokémon Blaze Black 2 and Volt White 2 Redux have been developed primarily by **AphexCubed**. However, this was far from a one-man project.

    About a year into development, AphexCubed showed Redux to Drayano. The rest, as they say, is history - they decided on a name and over the next year began a formal collaboration on Redux.
