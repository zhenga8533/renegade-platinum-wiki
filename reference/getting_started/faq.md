## Is Redux your project? How has Drayano been involved?

### Project Origins

**Redux is AphexCubed's project.** Work began in early COVID-19 lockdown (~March 2020), with development taking approximately two years.

Redux started as a way to pass the time and learn new skills, but AphexCubed quickly found a knack for ROM hacking. After about a year of development (~40% complete), AphexCubed reached out to Drayano and showed him an early build.

Dray liked what he saw and agreed to help out!

### Division of Labor

=== "AphexCubed (~80%)"

    **Project Lead**

    Responsible for:

    - **Scripting** - Making new events, tweaking and changing old ones
    - **Balancing** - Designing all Pokémon movesets and trainer teams, distributing items, modifying moves
    - **Text Changes** - Various dialogue and text updates (if you find spelling mistakes, they're probably his!)
    - **Design** - Writing and designing various new additions to the game
    - **Technical Work** - A fair amount of boring and miscellaneous technical work under the hood

    This is the meat of Redux and makes up the bulk of the project.

=== "Drayano (~15%)"

    **Development Partner** ([@Drayano60](https://twitter.com/Drayano60))

    His presence can be felt throughout the game:

    - **Rewriting** the majority of text in the game (significantly improved Redux quality)
    - **Promotion** of the project, particularly on Twitter
    - **Community Connections** - Putting AphexCubed in touch with various members
    - **Second Opinions** - Balance, text, playtesting feedback

=== "Community (~5%)"

    **Various Contributors**

    See the [Credits](credits.md) document for a full breakdown.

    Special mentions:

    - **Hello007**
    - **Phunsukh Wangdu** (formerly PlatinumMaster)
    - **Brom**

### Special Recognition: Koji

!!! success "Art & Graphics"

    **[@kojiyomi](https://twitter.com/kojiyomi)** - An invaluable unofficial member of Redux's development

    Created several pieces of art for Redux:

    - Redux logos (both in-game and used on Twitter)
    - Various in-game graphics like the Link Cable icon (made before Legends: Arceus was revealed - they totally called it!)

## Will there be a Blaze Black and Volt White Redux / other 'Redux' games?

### Current Plans

**No concrete plans currently.** Redux took two years to develop, and finding that much time again is challenging.

### Possible Future Projects

!!! note "Maybe One Day..."

    **Blaze Black & Volt White Redux**

    - Have some ideas for this
    - Would require significant time investment

    **Renegade Platinum Remake**

    - Mainly the balancing aspect
    - Couple of new events/scripts

    **Future Drayano Collaborations**

    - Open to working with Dray in the future
    - SGSS V2 is his solo project (may help with bouncing ideas around)

**Nothing is completely ruled out**, but don't expect anything soon!
