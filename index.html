<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>PokÃ©mon Renegade Platinum is an enhancement hack of PokÃ©mon Platinum Version, similar to <a href="https://x.com/drayano60" target="_blank">@Drayano60</a>'s other hacks such as Sacred Gold &amp; Storm Silver and Blaze Black &amp; Volt White. In a nutshell, this hack generally keeps the same story flow as the original PokÃ©mon Platinum but adds in a significant number of gameplay differences, including but not limited to access to all 493 PokÃ©mon in the game, revamped Trainers including tougher boss fights, lots of (optional) changes to weaker PokÃ©mon to make them easier to use, the removal of trade only evolutions and a number of other quality of life changes. The specifics of what parts have been changed are explained in the paragraphs below.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<h3 id="all-493-pokemon-available">All 493 PokÃ©mon Available</h3>
<p>All PokÃ©mon that were originally in Platinum, from Bulbasaur to Arceus, are available to obtain within the game. The wild PokÃ©mon for every single area have been modified extensively, now including species not ordinarily found in the Sinnoh region. It's possible to catch or obtain the majority of PokÃ©mon before facing the Elite Four for the first time, meaning you can construct almost any team you want. In the cases where a PokÃ©mon being in the wild would not be thematically appropriate - for example, starter PokÃ©mon or legendaries - new events have been added to the game to make obtaining these PokÃ©mon feel as unique as they normally would.</p>
<p>The details for where to get each PokÃ©mon can be found between the wild PokÃ©mon and special events documents. Additionally, the correct locations for wild PokÃ©mon are also shown in the PokÃ©dex. (Big thanks to Mikelan98 for that feature!)</p>
<h3 id="revamped-trainer-battles">Revamped Trainer Battles</h3>
<p>The PokÃ©mon rosters of every Trainer in the game has been edited, now including PokÃ©mon from the National Dex. Trainer levels have also been modified to fit the new level curve, which is now higher than before due to bigger PokÃ©mon rosters and greater use of evolved PokÃ©mon awarding larger amounts of EXP. Trainers can now expect their PokÃ©mon to reach the 70s by the Elite Four, instead of the 50s that was the case in the original Platinum. Additionally, all Trainers use the AI that is normally only used by boss Trainers such as the Elite Four.</p>
<p>The details for what each Trainer has can be seen in the Trainer Pokemon document. Please note that this feature is purely for the normal Trainer battles in the game; the Battle Frontier has not been changed.</p>
<h3 id="harder-boss-battles">Harder Boss Battles</h3>
<p>Important battles such as the rival, Gym Leaders, Galactic Admins or the Elite Four have had their difficulty increased further than normal Trainers. Gym Leaders and Elite Four members now always use 6 PokÃ©mon instead of the 3-5 from before, and all of these battles have them using high IV PokÃ©mon with custom movesets, held items, and sometimes ideal natures. The first round Elite Four and the Champion also have the unique property of randomly picking from four teams to battle you with, making it impossible to know in advance what their lead PokÃ©mon will be.</p>
<p>They shouldn't be literally impossible to beat, but are definitely a much greater challenge than the original version. You can expect some of your PokÃ©mon to faint in battle unless you bring some strategies of your own to the table.</p>
<p>However, they do retain their aesthetics from the original, including their type focuses and signature PokÃ©mon. Their signature PokÃ©mon are also now equipped with a PokÃ© Ball seal for some extra flair!</p>
<p>The details for all of these battles can be seen in the Trainer PokÃ©mon file in the documentation.</p>
<h3 id="pokemon-modifications">PokÃ©mon Modifications</h3>
<p>The Fairy-type from the Gen 6 games and later has been added in Renegade Platinum, replacing what was previously the ??? type. All PokÃ©mon have had their typing, base stats and wild held items updated to match what they are as of Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon, meaning you can now use PokÃ©mon such as Clefairy and Ralts with their Fairy-type as in the later games. Pelipper and Torkoal also gain their new Drizzle and Drought abilities from Gen 7, and a lot of PokÃ©mon gain their Hidden Ability from Gen 5 and later as a secondary standard ability in this hack.</p>
<p>All PokÃ©mon have also had their level up move sets completely revamped. PokÃ©mon will now learn their normal level up moves but now also learn other moves that enable them to be the best they can be, including TM moves, Egg moves and moves they only have access to in previous or later generations, up to and including Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee! Some PokÃ©mon also get the chance to learn entirely new moves that they never could before, such as Megahorn for Pinsir and Earth Power for Typhlosion. The levels at which they learn the moves have been structured so that you can reliably access them just by naturally playing the game (i.e. you won't get moves at extremely high levels).</p>
<p>Some PokÃ©mon have also had their TM/HM compatibility modified, in some cases adding in moves that they could ordinarily only learn in later generations (such as Drain Punch for Toxicroak), and other cases granting them access to entirely moves by TM (e.g. Drain Punch for Dusknoir). Additionally, several TMs have been replaced with new moves, including Scald, Wild Charge, Bug Buzz, Hyper Voice, Dazzling Gleam and Hurricane. PokÃ©mon TM compatibility has been adjusted to match their compatibility in later generations, or in the case of the newcomers Bug Buzz and Hurricane. There's also been much greater compatibility added for Fly, meaning you don't necessarily almost always need a Flying-type PokÃ©mon to get anywhere conveniently.</p>
<p>In addition to this, there are also a number of custom changes to make certain PokÃ©mon unique and/or easier to use. Many PokÃ©mon who are a bit weaker have received buffs to their base stats, meaning previously weak PokÃ©mon like Butterfree and Ledian can now actually put up a fighting chance. Some PokÃ©mon with decent stats in bad areas have had their stats reshuffled, such as Glaceon who is now faster but less defensive. Some PokÃ©mon have also been given new types to play with, such as the now Bug and Dragon-type Flygon, or the Ghost and Fairy-type Mismagius. Some PokÃ©mon also gain new abilities that they can't ordinarily get, such as Weavile gaining the Technician ability.</p>
<p>If you don't like the sort of changes that are listed in that last paragraph, there is an additional patch you can use called "ClassicVersion.xdelta" which will erase these changes from the game, leaving them the same as they would be as of Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon.</p>
<p>The details for these modifications can be found in the Pokemon Changes and Type Changes files in the documentation.</p>
<h3 id="quality-of-life-changes">Quality of Life Changes</h3>
<p>A number of quality of life changes have been made to the game.</p>
<p>All PokÃ©mon names are now decapitalised everywhere outside of standard NPC dialogue. This means in battle, the PokÃ©mon status screen etcetera, all names show up as they would in Gen V and later.</p>
<p>PokÃ©mon natures are now displayed in the stat screen with their stat boost and reduction shown next to them (as stat highlights were not a thing in Platinum). For example, where it previously said "Brave nature.", you should now see "Brave (+Atk, -Spe)".</p>
<p>All PokÃ©mon have their egg cycles reduced to 0, meaning they hatch very quickly.</p>
<p>The PokÃ© Radar is now given to you near the beginning of the game. The Bicycle is actually given to you at the start of the game. The PokÃ©tch, still given to you near the start, now includes all 25 PokÃ©tch apps right off the bat. Additionally, the three coupon miniquest has been removed.</p>
<p>The Move Relearner and the Move Tutors that previously required Heart Scales and Shards respectively no longer require payment for their services; you can just talk to them and they'll do their job for free. Additionally, all three Move Tutors now sit in the same house on the southern part of Route 212. The Move Deleter is now available as early as Oreburgh City, meaning you no longer need to wait until Canalave City to delete any HMs.</p>
<p>When fishing with a rod, an encounter is now guaranteed, as opposed to previously where it was possible to 'not get a bite'. Honey trees have also been given a total overhaul and now give you a PokÃ©mon instantly instead of you having to wait for several hours. The encounters for honey trees are different from before as they are now script driven - you can view what is on each tree in the Wild PokÃ©mon document.</p>
<p>TMs are now effectively infinite; picking up or obtaining a TM will reward you with 99 copies of that TM, and these can also be refreshed by talking to a new NPC at the PokÃ©mon League. These TMs cannot be bought at any stores and also cannot be sold. Most TM locations have been reshuffled and can be seen in the Item Locations document. You will only find TMs from either picking them up off the ground or receiving them from NPCs. (It unfortunately proved impossible to make the TMs actually infinite, hence this method instead).</p>
<p>The need to use HMs has been removed where possible. Surf, Waterfall and Rock Climb are still necessary, but Cut trees, Strength rocks (with one exception in the Distortion World), Rock Smash rocks and foggy weather have been completely removed from the game, meaning your PokÃ©mon no longer need to learn these moves to progress. Where roadblocks are necessary, NPCs have replaced them and will disappear when necessary. This does mean there are now some cases where you can access areas much earlier than you were previously able to do. Additionally, any darkness on the map has also been removed, meaning Flash is also no longer ever necessary.</p>
<p>The PokÃ©mon sprites are those normally used in Heart Gold and Soul Silver, which for the most part look better than the Platinum equivalents. There are a couple exceptions to this where I've left the front sprite as the Platinum one for PokÃ©mon such as Blastoise, Vaporeon, Jolteon, Tyranitar and Togekiss. Additionally, the mini sprites used in the PokÃ©mon menu and the Boxes are now the Gen 6 icons (albeit some with some slightly off colours), with thanks to MeroMero for distributing a premade file containing them.</p>
<p>Most of these changes are not documented anywhere, but you may notice them as you play through the game.</p>
<h3 id="increased-shiny-rate">Increased Shiny Rate</h3>
<p>By default, Renegade Platinum features a new shiny rate of 1/512, meaning while shiny PokÃ©mon are still reasonably rare, it's significantly more likely that you'll come across one while playing the game. This shiny rate does not affect the PokÃ© Radar's ability to generate shiny patches of grass, but does otherwise affect every other method of PokÃ©mon encounter (eggs, gifts, wild etc).</p>
<p>If this feature is undesirable, there are additional patches included in the download that can make the shiny rate 1/4096 (equal to Gen 6 and above) or 1/8192 (equal to Platinum's normal rate) instead.</p>

<p>The download includes a "SpeedUpPatch" which can be applied to Renegade Platinum which adds a few things to speed up the normally sluggish gameplay in Platinum. It does three things: all text will appear instantly, HP and EXP bars will no longer animate between positions and the 30 FPS cap of the game has been removed, allowing it to run up to a maximum of 60 FPS depending on the hardware capability. These changes together mean battles can go significantly faster.</p>
<p>Please note that these speed up features are not included in the base Renegade Platinum and need to be applied via one of the additional patches supplied in the download.</p>
<h3 id="new-events-and-npcs">New Events and NPCs</h3>
<p>A number of small events have been added to the game, including an additional event with Team Galactic, small events to obtain starters and legendaries, more in-depth events to get mythical PokÃ©mon such as Mew, Celebi and Arceus and more.</p>
<p>Some new events have also been added that change the story flow slightly. For example, upon arriving at Eterna City, you will find that Gardenia isn't present at her gym. The player is instead required to make a short detour to Route 216 - which was previously inaccessible until gaining six badges - giving them the chance to pick up some Ice-type PokÃ©mon much earlier than before. Another example is that the player now visits Pal Park between going to Celestic Town and Canalave City.</p>
<p>You also now battle Lucas or Dawn a few times as you go about your adventure! In addition, there are also some battles with each of the stat trainers (Cheryl, Mira etc), related to their individual events.</p>
<p>There are lots of small events that allow you to obtain PokÃ©mon. For example, you can get an Eevee early in the game that is being taken care of by the player's mother. You can get a Lapras from an old lady in Pastoria City who has a small story to tell, and you can get a Beldum by talking to Steven, who is now taking up residence in Oreburgh City. And much more!</p>
<p>There are also a number of additional NPCs that will do things such as sell you evolution items, give you items unique to certain PokÃ©mon such as the Stick, and a whole new training NPC in Solaceon Town's PokÃ©mon Daycare who will help you train your PokÃ©mon in levels or EVs, making any necessary grinding a lot faster.</p>
<p>The details for some of these modifications can be found in the NPC Changes and Special Events files in the documentation.</p>
<h3 id="evolution-modifications">Evolution Modifications</h3>
<p>PokÃ©mon that previously had to be traded to evolve can now evolve within the game itself. Those that evolve by trade and did not require an item now simply evolve at Level 36. Those that did require an item can now evolve by having the item used on them, similar to an evolution stone.</p>
<p>Additionally, a number of PokÃ©mon have had their evolution levels lowered to make them easier to use. For example, Omanyte and Kabuto, who previously wouldn't evolve until a high level 40, now evolve at a much easier Level 30, allowing them to keep up with the other PokÃ©mon in your teams.</p>
<p>Finally, some evolution methods were changed to be less restrictive. PokÃ©mon who could evolve from happiness at specific times of the day now just need to be happy, and Eevee, who previously required happiness and location evolutions, now uses standard evolutionary stones for all of its evolutions.</p>
<p>The details for these modifications can be found in the Evolution Changes file in the documentation.</p>
<h3 id="move-modifications">Move Modifications</h3>
<p>A number of useless or rarely seen moves have been replaced with moves from later generations. Examples include Draining Kiss, Scald, Icicle Crash, Drill Run, Moonblast, Dazzling Gleam, Disarming Voice, Bulldoze, Play Rough, Hurricane and Wild Charge. New moves borrow animations from other moves that are similar (e.g. Drill Run uses Horn Drill's animation), or have animations that are slightly modified from a different move (e.g. Moonblast uses Mist Ball with a moon background). These new moves can be learnt by level up or in some cases, TM.</p>
<p>In addition to this, a number of moves have had their stats adjusted slightly. For example, Shadow Punch and Shadow Claw are now a much stronger 80 base power. HMs in particular have been boosted to make them more attractive as battling moves, such as Fly now having 100% accuracy and Rock Climb being a Rock-type move.</p>
<p>The details for these modifications can be found in the Move Changes file in the documentation.</p>
<h3 id="item-modifications">Item Modifications</h3>
<p>The locations of many items in the game have been shuffled around, allowing the player better access to them throughout the game. For example, the various evolution items are now found much earlier in the game, and can also be purchased from either the Veilstone Department Store, the Veilstone Game Corner or from an NPC in Snowpoint City. Locations for most items are shown in the Item Changes document. You'll be able to find items such as the EXP Share and the Soothe Bell much earlier than previously.</p>
<p>TMs are now effectively infinite, as explained in the quality of life changes.</p>
<p>PokÃ© Balls, Great Balls and Ultra Balls have also been made cheaper to assist the player in what will likely end up being a greater amount of PokÃ©mon caught than normal.</p>
<p>A few previously unused items are now used or replaced with new Key Items as well, relevant to new events within the game. Additionally, the previously event only Key Items such as the Secret Key, Member's Card, Gracidea and Azure Flute can now be obtained and their relevant events unlocked within the normal gameplay.</p>
<p>The details for these modifications can be found in the Item Changes file in the documentation.</p>
<h3 id="trade-modifications">Trade Modifications</h3>
<p>The in-game trades found in Platinum have been adjusted to give you new PokÃ©mon that are otherwise hard to find at the stage of the game the trade is at. For example, you can now trade for a Spheal in Oreburgh City. In addition to this, the obedience check that makes traded PokÃ©mon not listen to you has been disabled, meaning you can use these traded PokÃ©mon with no worries.</p>
<p>The details for these modifications can be found in the Trade Changes file in the documentation.</p>
<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>
<p>As you may have seen at the end of each section, there is documentation available in the form of text files for mostly every change that has been made in the game. The files are included in the download for the hack, but can also be viewed online on <a href="https://pastebin.com/u/RenegadePlatinum" target="_blank">Pastebin</a>.</p>
<h2 id="tools-used">Tools Used</h2>
<p>BTX Editor: Made by KazoWAR, this tool was helpful for getting some new overworlds into the game, such as Steven, a few of the legendaries and more.</p>
<p>crystaltile2: An invaluable tool for importing/exporting/locating particular files from NARCs, as well as being very helpful when implementing the Fairy-type.</p>
<p>Hex Workshop: Helpful for those times where I needed to do things via hex editing.</p>
<p>JackHack Tools: A number of tools from his site were used, including a PokÃ©mon Editor, Attack Editor and Trade Editor.</p>
<p>kiwiDS: Helpful for some cases where I needed to get the individual files for a NARC.</p>
<p>Lua Scripts: A Lua script by Kaphotics that displayed the X/Y coordinate of the player on the map, allowing me to position overworlds correctly.</p>
<p>PKHeX: While not used for actual development, it came in useful a few times to figure out how things worked.</p>
<p>PokeDSPic Platinum: Used in a few cases where sprites had to be modified from their standard HG/SS versions.</p>
<p>PPRE: Used primarily for scripting and placing overworlds on the map, as well as some text editing. Both 0.14b and 0.12 were used to get around the issues related to freezes caused when saving the script in 0.14b.</p>
<p>SDSME: Used for editing text that wasn't tied to a map, as well as configuring the "weather" for places like Twinleaf Town and Wayward Cave.</p>
<p>Tinke: Extremely helpful for some graphical changes, including the Steven trainer sprite and adding the Renegade Platinum logo to the title screen.</p>
<h2 id="credits">Credits</h2>
<p>Alpha, SCV: The creators of PPRE, which was incredibly useful.</p>
<p>JackHack96: I used a number of his tools when building the hack.</p>
<p>JimB16: For his Platinum disassembly on GitHub. While it wasn't used to actually develop with, it came in useful quite a few times to locate certain bits of data (including the solution for dealing with the traded PokÃ©mon obedience issue).</p>
<p>Kaphotics: A very talented hacker in the data mining sense, Kaphotics' wealth of NDS knowledge helped me to avoid one or two potential issues as I was building the game; his advice was incredibly helpful. The Lua scripts for the player's position and the Instant Text code that is implemented into the "SpeedUpPatch" were both made by him, too.</p>
<p>KazoWAR: For his BTX editor tool as well as his YouTube tutorial on adding Trainer sprites to Pt/HG/SS via Tinke.</p>
<p>Markitus95: The creator of SDSME, which was also useful.</p>
<p>MeroMero: Another extremely talented NDS hacker, MeroMero posted a lot of tutorials on Project PokÃ©mon that were directly relevant to things I wanted to do, such as changing the shiny rate or finding out how to adjust the position of PokÃ©mon sprites in battle. His tutorial for adding Fairy-type to HG/SS was also what I adapted to get it working in Platinum. Finally, the Gen 6 mini PokÃ©mon icons were also completely thanks to him (as seen <a href="https://projectpokemon.org/home/forums/topic/36081-gen-6-pokÃ©mon-icons-for-gen-4-and-5/" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>
<p>mikelan98: An extremely talented NDS hacker, he produced lots of helpful tutorials for NDS hacking, and it was also him who provided files allowing me to show PokÃ©mon locations in the PokÃ©dex and for the Fairy-type icon to display correctly in the PokÃ©dex. Both of these would have been impossible without him!</p>
<p>sylphate: A talented graphics artist who made the logo for Renegade Platinum. He's also the artist for the logo for my Rising Ruby and Sinking Sapphire hacks!</p>
<p>I'd also like to thank my fanbase in general, who are always very encouraging and excitable. It wouldn't be half as fun to make these without you guys around!</p>
<h2 id="known-bugs">Known Bugs</h2>
