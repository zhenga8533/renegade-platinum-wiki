## Tools Used

The following tools were essential in creating Renegade Platinum:

BTX Editor
:   Made by **KazoWAR**. Used for importing new overworlds into the game, including Steven, legendaries, and more.

    - Pokémon Editor
    - Attack Editor
    - Trade Editor

kiwiDS
:   Helpful for extracting individual files from NARCs in certain cases.

Lua Scripts
:   **Kaphotics'** Lua script that displayed the X/Y coordinates of the player on the map, allowing precise overworld positioning.

PKHeX
:   While not used for actual development, it was useful for understanding how certain mechanics worked.

PokeDSPic Platinum
:   Used when sprites had to be modified from their standard HG/SS versions.

PPRE
:   Used primarily for:

    - Scripting
    - Placing overworlds on maps

    - Editing text not tied to maps
    - Configuring "weather" for locations like Twinleaf Town and Wayward Cave

Tinke
:   Extremely helpful for graphical changes, including:

    - Steven trainer sprite
    - Adding the Renegade Platinum logo to the title screen

!!! info "Custom Tools"

    Some custom tools were created specifically for handling wild encounters and level-up moves, as existing tools had usability issues or bugs. These tools aren't currently publicly available but can be shared on request.
