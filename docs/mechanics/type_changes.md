# Type Changes

## General Changes

1. Fairy-type is now in the game, replacing what was previously the ??? type.
1. All Pokémon that are Fairy-type in Gen VI onwards are also Fairy-type in Renegade Platinum. This is true for the Complete and the Classic versions.
1. Rotom's five alternate forms take the secondary type that they have in the Gen V games and onward (i.e. they are not Ghost-type like the normal Platinum).
1. For other type changes, they are only present in the Complete version of the hack. If you don't like these changes, use the Classic version patch instead.
