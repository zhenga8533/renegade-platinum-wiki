## :material-pokemon-go: All 493 Pokémon Available

All Pokémon that were originally in Platinum, from **Bulbasaur to Arceus**, are available to obtain within the game. The wild Pokémon for every single area have been modified extensively, now including species not ordinarily found in the Sinnoh region.

!!! success "Team Building Freedom"

    It's possible to catch or obtain the **majority of Pokémon before facing the Elite Four** for the first time, meaning you can construct almost any team you want.

In cases where a Pokémon being in the wild would not be thematically appropriate—for example, starter Pokémon or legendaries—new events have been added to the game to make obtaining these Pokémon feel as unique as they normally would.

!!! tip "Finding Pokémon Locations"

    - Check the [Wild Pokémon](reference/wild_pokemon.md) and [Special Events](reference/special_events.md) documentation
    - Look in the **Pokédex** for correct wild locations (thanks to Mikelan98!)

---

## :material-account-group: Revamped Trainer Battles

The Pokémon rosters of **every Trainer** in the game have been edited, now including Pokémon from the National Dex. Trainer levels have been modified to fit the new level curve, which is now higher than before due to bigger Pokémon rosters and greater use of evolved Pokémon awarding larger amounts of EXP.

!!! warning "Higher Level Curve"

    Trainers can expect their Pokémon to reach **the 70s by the Elite Four**, instead of the 50s that was the case in the original Platinum.

Additionally, **all Trainers use the AI** that is normally only used by boss Trainers such as the Elite Four.

!!! info "Trainer Details"

    View what each Trainer has in the [Trainer Pokémon](reference/trainer_pokemon.md) document. Note: The Battle Frontier has not been changed.

---

## :material-sword-cross: Harder Boss Battles

Important battles such as the rival, Gym Leaders, Galactic Admins or the Elite Four have had their difficulty increased further than normal Trainers.

**Key Changes:**

- Gym Leaders and Elite Four now always use **6 Pokémon** (instead of 3-5)
- All boss Pokémon have high IVs with custom movesets, held items, and sometimes ideal natures
- **Elite Four and Champion randomly pick from 4 teams**, making it impossible to know their lead in advance

!!! danger "Prepare for a Challenge"

    These battles are **much more difficult** than the original version. Expect some of your Pokémon to faint unless you bring strategies of your own!

However, they retain their aesthetics from the original, including their type focuses and signature Pokémon. Their signature Pokémon are also now equipped with a **Poké Ball seal** for some extra flair!

---

## :material-star: Pokémon Modifications

### Typing and Stats

!!! success "Fairy-Type Added"

    The **Fairy-type** from Gen 6 games has been added, replacing the ??? type. All Pokémon have had their typing, base stats and wild held items updated to match **Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon**.

- Use Clefairy and Ralts with their Fairy-type
- Pelipper and Torkoal gain their **Drizzle** and **Drought** abilities from Gen 7
- Many Pokémon gain their Hidden Ability from Gen 5+ as a secondary standard ability

### Movesets

All Pokémon have had their **level-up movesets completely revamped**. Pokémon now learn:

- Normal level-up moves
- TM moves, Egg moves, and moves from previous/later generations (up to Let's Go)
- Entirely new moves they never could before (e.g., **Megahorn** for Pinsir, **Earth Power** for Typhlosion)

!!! tip "Move Learning Levels"

    Moves are structured so you can reliably access them just by naturally playing the game—no extremely high levels required!

### TM/HM Compatibility

Several TMs have been replaced with new moves, including:

- **Scald**, **Wild Charge**, **Bug Buzz**
- **Hyper Voice**, **Dazzling Gleam**, **Hurricane**

Pokémon TM compatibility has been adjusted to match later generations, with **much greater compatibility for Fly**, meaning you don't necessarily need a Flying-type to travel conveniently.

### Custom Changes

??? tip "Optional Pokémon Buffs (Click to expand)"

    Many weaker Pokémon have received buffs to be more viable:

    - **Stat buffs** for previously weak Pokémon like Butterfree and Ledian
    - **Stat reshuffles** for Pokémon with decent stats in bad areas (e.g., Glaceon is now faster but less defensive)
    - **New types** for some Pokémon (e.g., **Bug/Dragon** Flygon, **Ghost/Fairy** Mismagius)
    - **New abilities** (e.g., Weavile gains **Technician**)

    !!! warning "Don't Like These Changes?"
        Use the **ClassicVersion.xdelta** patch to erase custom changes, leaving Pokémon as they are in Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon.

!!! info "Documentation"

    Details in [Pokémon Changes](changes/pokemon_changes.md) and [Type Changes](changes/type_changes.md) files

## :material-wrench: Quality of Life Changes

### Display Improvements

- **Decapitalized Pokémon names** everywhere outside standard NPC dialogue (like Gen V+)
- **Nature stat changes shown** in stat screen (e.g., "Brave (+Atk, -Spe)")
- All Pokémon **egg cycles reduced to 0**, meaning they hatch very quickly

### Early Game Unlocks

!!! success "Items Given Early"

    - **Bicycle** - Given at the start of the game
    - **Poké Radar** - Given near the beginning
    - **Pokétch** - Includes all 25 apps right away (three coupon quest removed)

### Free Services

!!! tip "No More Payments!"

    - **Move Relearner** - No longer requires Heart Scales
    - **Move Tutors** - No longer require Shards
    - All three Move Tutors now in the same house on **Route 212** (south)
    - **Move Deleter** - Available as early as Oreburgh City

### Encounter Improvements

- **Fishing** - Guaranteed encounter (no more "not a bite")
- **Honey Trees** - Instant encounters instead of waiting hours
- Honey tree encounters are now script-driven (see Wild Pokémon document)

### TMs and Items

!!! success "Effectively Infinite TMs"

    Picking up a TM rewards you with **99 copies**. These can be refreshed by talking to a new NPC at the Pokémon League. TMs cannot be bought or sold.

!!! info "TM Locations Reshuffled"

    TMs are only found on the ground or from NPCs. See [Item Changes](changes/item_changes.md) document.

### HM Reduction

!!! success "HMs Mostly Removed"

    **Still required:** Surf, Waterfall, Rock Climb

    **Completely removed:**

    - Cut trees
    - Strength rocks (except one in Distortion World)
    - Rock Smash rocks
    - Foggy weather
    - Darkness (Flash no longer needed)

    NPCs have replaced roadblocks where necessary, meaning some areas are accessible much earlier than before!

### Visual Improvements

- **Pokémon sprites** are from Heart Gold & Soul Silver (better quality)
- Some exceptions kept Platinum sprites (Blastoise, Vaporeon, Jolteon, Tyranitar, Togekiss)
- **Gen 6 mini sprites** used in menus and Boxes (thanks to MeroMero!)

### Increased Shiny Rate

!!! info "Default Shiny Rate: 1/512"

    Shiny Pokémon are still reasonably rare, but **significantly more likely** to appear while playing. This affects all encounter methods (eggs, gifts, wild) except the Poké Radar's shiny patches.

??? tip "Alternative Shiny Rates Available"

    Additional patches included in the download:

    - **1/4096** - Equal to Gen 6 and above
    - **1/8192** - Equal to Platinum's normal rate

### :material-speedometer: Increased Gameplay Speed

!!! warning "Optional Speed Up Patch"

    The **SpeedUpPatch** is included in the download as an additional patch. It is **NOT** included in the base Renegade Platinum.

The Speed Up Patch does three things:

1. **Instant text** - All text appears immediately
2. **No HP/EXP bar animations** - Bars jump to positions instantly
3. **60 FPS cap removed** - Game can run up to 60 FPS (depending on hardware)

These changes together mean battles can go **significantly faster**.

## :material-gift: New Events and NPCs

### Story Flow Changes

Some new events change the story flow slightly:

!!! example "Route 216 Early Access"

    Upon arriving at Eterna City, Gardenia isn't at her gym. You're required to make a short detour to **Route 216** (previously inaccessible until 6 badges), giving you a chance to pick up Ice-type Pokémon much earlier!

- Visit **Pal Park** between Celestic Town and Canalave City
- Battle **Lucas or Dawn** a few times throughout your adventure
- Battle each of the stat trainers (Cheryl, Mira, etc.) in their individual events

**Examples:** Draining Kiss, Scald, Icicle Crash, Drill Run, Moonblast, Dazzling Gleam, Disarming Voice, Bulldoze, Play Rough, Hurricane, Wild Charge

!!! tip "Move Animations"

    New moves borrow animations from similar moves (e.g., Drill Run uses Horn Drill's animation) or use slightly modified animations (e.g., Moonblast uses Mist Ball with a moon background).
