## General Changes

- Each of the four trades has been modified to accept different Pokémon.
- The trade that was previously in Snowpoint City has been moved to Floaroma Town.
- The mechanic that causes traded Pokémon to not listen to you without certain badges has been removed. Traded Pokémon will now always listen to your commands.
