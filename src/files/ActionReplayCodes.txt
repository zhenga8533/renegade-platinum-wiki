General
=========================================================
- These are some Action Replay codes which might be helpful to make the game play a bit faster.
- Please note that the Game ID is different to the original Platinum. You can find this value out with the R4 Cheat Code Editor program if you need it.
- These can also be applied to the ROM as an additional patch which is supplied with the download.

=========================================================
Instant Text
=========================================================
This code will make all text appear instantly instead of a gradual scroll.
Please note that it will stop you hearing certain fanfares (e.g. the sound effect after an evolution).

=========================================================
Gauge Animation Cut
=========================================================
This code will make it so HP bars drop instantly instead of gradually.
Please note that it won't have any effect until the HP bars are over a certain value, so the effect won't be immediately apparent early on.
